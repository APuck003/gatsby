So _that_Â just happened. March was one heck of a month, but we made it through to April (no foolin'). Togetherâ€”from a responsible six feet apart, of courseâ€”we'll support each other through this challenge. Here at Gatsby, we've already started helping where we can, among all the other busy-ness we were up to in the past few weeks.

# Gatsby Resources To Help the Helpers

We want to first thank [Bob Orchard](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributors/bob-orchard/&sa=D&ust=1585680303298000), a senior product manager here at Gatsby, for first proposing and then taking lead on the [Service Relief Project](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-03-26-service-relief-project/&sa=D&ust=1585680303298000). This is what happens when a bunch of Gatsbyites get together after business hours to do whatever we can to help in this current crisis: a zero-cost, open source boilerplate for building a community directory of fundraisers for suddenly out of work service workers and small businesses forced to close. To date, there are Service Relief websites for [Seattle](https://seattleservicerelief.com/&sa=D&ust=1585680303298000), [Denver](https://denverservicerelief.com/&sa=D&ust=1585680303299000), [Sioux Falls](https://siouxfallsservicerelief.com/&sa=D&ust=1585680303299000), and [Asheville](https://ashevilleservicerelief.com/&sa=D&ust=1585680303299000), among others. We're grateful to all those who have used the Service Relief Project to help out in their hometowns as we do what we can to support our communities.

ManyÂ of us are also home with our kids, and we're suddenly doing double time as we both work from home and homeschool, often for the first time. We get it; many of us are juggling these very same balls. So on March 25, Gatsby's Learning Team members started a free livestream series designed to walk kids (13 years old and older) through the basic skills needed to create web pages, starting with HTML and CSS and working up to JavaScript. The livestreams are an hour twice a week for the next 5 weeks (Wednesdays and Fridays at 1pm ET/10amPT), streaming over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gatsbyjs&sa=D&ust=1585680303300000) and including live examples on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/&sa=D&ust=1585680303300000). The recordings are also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjnp770qk7ujOq8Q9wiC82w&sa=D&ust=1585680303300000). If your kids want to participate, please email us at [web-creators@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:web-creators@gatsbyjs.com).

# Thinkpiece: Changing the OS Status Quo

This month's deep thought dive: [Changing the Open Source Status Quo](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-02-17-changing-the-oss-status-quo/&sa=D&ust=1585680303301000), taking a look at the not so "open" (i.e. inclusive) culture prevalent in too much of the open source development community. How does this happen, why does it persist, and what can we do to make things better?

Fun fact: the author of this piece, Aisha Blake, [learned to code using Neopets](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/324436/How_Neopets_has_influenced_a_generation_of_game_developers.php&sa=D&ust=1585680303302000)!

# New Gatsby Tips, Tricks, and How-To's

Over the last month, we've covered minor and major head-scratchers. As part of the ongoing "Challenges" series, Hashim Warren gave solutions for these challenges:

- [Keep Your Gatsby Site Blazing Fast](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/performance/&sa=D&ust=1585680303303000)
- [Source Data from a Headless CMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/cms/&sa=D&ust=1585680303303000)
- [Transform Your Gatsby Website into a Web App](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/apps/&sa=D&ust=1585680303304000)
- [[Enable Comments to Your Gatsby Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/comments/&sa=D&ust=1585680303304000)

We also reviewed a variety of plug-ins for [optimizing media assets](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-12-faster-sites-with-optimized-media-assets/&sa=D&ust=1585680303305000), [using feature flags](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-03-23-Flying-Feature-Flags-with-New-LaunchDarkly-plugin/&sa=D&ust=1585680303305000), and [using Netlify Functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-03-11-netlify-functions-and-gatsby-cloud/&sa=D&ust=1585680303305000).

# Success Story of the Month

[Tara Arnold](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributors/tara-arnold/&sa=D&ust=1585680303306000) wrote [a case study](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-03-30-Fast-Secure-Flexible-MagMutual/&sa=D&ust=1585680303306000)Â about [MagMutual](https://www.magmutual.com/&sa=D&ust=1585680303306000), a healthcare liability insurer which needed a faster and more flexible website upgrade that would still securely protect and serve their policyholders. Collaborating with [Mediacurrent](https://www.mediacurrent.com/&sa=D&ust=1585680303307000), MagMutual decided to use a fully decoupled Drupal 8 system with Gatsby: the Drupal 8 backend enabled powerful content modeling while Gatsby provided flexibility and performance in the presentation layer. The new build is resilient and nimble, perfect for a website at the intersection of healthcare and insurance.

# March Tech Changes

Just as an FYI: effective in Gatsby v2.20.0 we're dropping support for Node 8. The minimum Node version that we'll be supporting is 10.13.0. If you've already upgraded your version of Node to 10.13.0, you won't be affected.

These are just some of the highlights. Many more things happened. (So many, many more. Like we have to tell you that. Keep in touch during these interesting times, and while sheltering in place maybe check out Gatsby's Head of Product [Dustin Schau on the JS Party podcast] (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-03-09-gatsby-and-jsparty-podcast/). Now go wash your hands, and let's head into April together ðŸ’œ.
